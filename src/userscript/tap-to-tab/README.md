# Tap to Tab

A userscript that supports opening new tabs in the background when double-clicking links.

Since the extension [Tap to Tab](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tap-to-tab/enhajhmncplakageabmopgpodkdgcodd) lacks updates, making it unusable on newer versions of Chrome:

> This extension doesn't follow Chrome extensions best practices, so it may soon stop being supported.

Therefore, we forked it as a Tampermonkey script for independent maintenance.
